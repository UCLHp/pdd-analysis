# pdd-analysis

This repo contains code that will automatically analyse depth dose data files. It accepts data in both an mcc format as from the Giraffe Multi-Layer Ionisation Chmaber (MLIC), and csv/xlsx format as from the water tank.

![Current Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-green.svg)

## Components

### commissioning_pdds.py

For analysing one set of depth dose files. Asks user to input the directory of the mcc or csv files and a save location, outputs an excel file with each sheet corresponding to a beam energy.

### database_interaction.py

Contains functions that allow the user to connect to an access database to pull information from tables or sort data into formats that can easily be written into the database.

### pdd_module.py

Contains functions and classes that help the manipulation of pdd data, including classes for working with pdd data and with bragg peak properties.

### pdd_qa.py

For ongoing QA measurements using either a water tank and chamber combination, or the Giraffe MLIC. Will determing the relevant peak properties of the acquired PDDs and compare them to reference values. Results are then stored in the database.

### pdd_vs_refdata.py

Script to produce an excel spreadsheet comparing two sets of pdds. Peak properties are compared and a gamma analysis is performed. Results are stored on sheets corresponding to the bragg peak energy.

### pdd-w2cad.py

Uses the spreadsheet output of **commissioning_pdds.py**.<br>
Converts the PDD in each sheet within the spreadsheet into a `.w2cad` file which is the format required by Eclipse TPS for beam model creation.

## Installation - requires python v3 and git

Note: we currently use a 32-bit version of Access and so if you wish to run any part of this code that communicates with the database (pdd_qa.py) you must use a 32-bit version of Python. One way of doing this is through conda environments, for example.

Use the command line and navigate to where you would like to store the repo. Clone the repo, navigate to the cloned folder and create a virtual environment using the following commands (locations are examples only):

```python
cd C:\Desktop\PutRepoInThisFile
git clone https://github.com/UCLHp/pdd-analysis.git
cd C:\Desktop\PutRepoInThisFile\pdd-analysis
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Install the required libraries:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the latest 40 digit git commit hash from the master branch at <https://github.com/UCLHp/pdd-analysis/commits/master> and paste this into the MASTER_HASH variable on line 5 of test.test_version.py.

### Requirements

Required libraries and versions can be found in requirements.txt and can be installed into virtual environment as shown above.

### Tests

One test currently included that will run within commissioning_pdds, pdd_qa and pdd_vs_refdata to check that the master branch hasn't been updated since the repo was cloned.

## Usage

PDD files acquired in a given session should be stored in a single directory with file names that correspond to the bragg peak energy e.g. 70.mcc or 70.csv

If more than one bragg peak is acquired at the same energy it should be stored in a separate file.

Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo and run from the command line for example:

```python
cd C:\Desktop\PutRepoInThisFile\pdd-analysis
python pdd_qa.py
```

## Limitations / Known Bugs

- Too many 'measurement types' are listed because they have not been differentiated in the access form yet
- Cannot accommodate non integer energies
- Normalisation currently set to Dmax - but this can be changed
